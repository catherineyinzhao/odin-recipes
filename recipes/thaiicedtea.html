        <ol>
            <li>Add the Thai tea mix, water, and sugar to a large pot. Heat until the sugar is completely dissolved, approximately 3-5 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the Thai tea steep for 30 minutes, until it's very dark reddish-orange in color.</li>
            <li>Use your Thai tea sock filter to strain the tea mix from the tea. Let the tea cool to room temperature and then chill in the fridge for several hours.</li>
            <li>Add ice to fill a tall glass. Pour approximately 1 cup of the chilled tea into the glass and then top with 3-4 tablespoons of half and half cream. Add a straw, stir, and enjoy!</li>
